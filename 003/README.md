robots-and-lasers-ruby
======================

This is a quick-and-dirty solution to <http://www.puzzlenode.com/puzzles/4-robots-vs-lasers>, so I can hang out with the cool kids at <http://www.meetup.com/CoderNight/events/156783322/>.

My goal was to create:
* a working solution
* in an hour or less
* covered reasonably by tests
* using small methods and single-responsibility classes.

The file- and line-parsing is inelegant. The classes are not quite single-responsibility. It could be heavily refactored. You know, the usual.
